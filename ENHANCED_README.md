# Enhanced Claude Code UI - Implementation Guide

## 🚀 What's New

This enhanced version of Claude Code UI provides **complete transparency** into what Claude is doing:

### Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Tool Execution Monitor** - See exactly which files Claude is reading/writing
2. **Process Breakdown Visualization** - Multi-phase operation tracking
3. **Resource Metrics Dashboard** - Token usage, costs, performance
4. **Dual-Stream Architecture** - Captures both JSON and terminal output
5. **Enhanced Error Context** - Detailed errors with actionable fixes

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install new dependencies
npm install ansi-to-html chart.js react-chartjs-2

# Start enhanced version
npm run dev:enhanced
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced CLI Wrapper** (`server/claude-cli-enhanced.js`)
   - Spawns TWO Claude processes: one for JSON, one for terminal
   - Captures rich context about tool executions
   - Tracks metrics in real-time

2. **ANSI Parser** (`server/utils/ansi-parser.js`)
   - Converts terminal colors to HTML
   - Extracts meaningful information from output

### Frontend Components

1. **EnhancedLayout** (`src/components/EnhancedLayout.jsx`)
   - Multi-panel interface with tabs
   - Responsive right panel for monitoring

2. **ToolExecutionMonitor** (`src/components/ToolExecutionMonitor.jsx`)
   - Real-time visualization of tool runs
   - Expandable details for each execution
   - Shows file paths, patterns, commands

3. **MetricsDashboard** (`src/components/MetricsDashboard.jsx`)
   - Token usage with visual progress bar
   - Cost estimation
   - Performance metrics
   - Sparkline charts

4. **ProcessBreakdown** (`src/components/ProcessBreakdown.jsx`)
   - Phase-by-phase operation tracking
   - Progress indicators
   - Time estimates

## 🔧 Usage

### Enable Enhanced Mode

In your `.env` file:
```
ENHANCED_MODE=true
CAPTURE_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=true
```

### View Different Panels

1. Click the panel icon in the top-right to toggle the monitoring panel
2. Switch between tabs:
   - **Tools**: Real-time tool executions
   - **Process**: Operation phases
   - **Metrics**: Resource usage

### Understanding the Display

#### Tool Execution:
```
🔍 READ OPERATION
├── File: /src/App.jsx (1,247 lines)
├── Purpose: "Analyzing component structure"
├── Progress: ████████░░ 80%
└── Duration: 1.2s
```

#### Process Phases:
```
✅ Phase 1: Analysis (2.1s)
   ✓ Read package.json (340ms)
   ✓ Scan project structure (1.2s)
   
🔄 Phase 2: Planning
   ✓ Identify components
   ⟳ Plan state management
   ○ Design API integration
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Educational**: Learn how Claude approaches problems
2. **Debugging**: See exactly what went wrong
3. **Performance**: Track resource usage
4. **Trust**: No "black box" - see every decision

## 🔍 Example Session

When Claude refactors authentication:

**Chat Panel**: Shows conversation
**Tools Panel**: 
- Reading auth.js, login.jsx
- Searching for "useAuth" pattern
- Writing updated files

**Process Panel**:
- Phase 1: Analysis ✅
- Phase 2: Planning ✅
- Phase 3: Implementation 🔄
- Phase 4: Testing ⏳

**Metrics Panel**:
- Tokens: 15,247 / 200k
- Cost: $0.24
- Duration: 3m 42s
- Tools run: 47

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Terminal output not showing
- Ensure Claude CLI supports raw output
- Check WebSocket connection in browser console

### High memory usage
- Limit stored tool executions in settings
- Clear old sessions regularly

### Performance issues
- Disable terminal capture for large operations
- Use filtered view for specific tools

## 🤝 Contributing

Help make Claude Code UI even more transparent:

1. Add new visualization types
2. Improve ANSI parsing
3. Add export capabilities
4. Create custom monitors

## 📝 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Record and replay sessions
- [ ] Export detailed reports
- [ ] Custom alerts for specific patterns
- [ ] Integration with VS Code
- [ ] Collaborative monitoring

This enhanced UI transforms Claude Code from a chat interface into a **complete development dashboard** where you can see, understand, and learn from every action Claude takes.
